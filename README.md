JSON BinPack
============

JSON BinPack is an open-source binary [JSON](https://www.json.org)
serialization format with a strong focus on space efficiency. It can run in
schema-driven and schema-less mode to encode any JSON document given a matching
[JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org).

Documentation
-------------

The complete documentation is available at the official website:

https://www.jsonbinpack.org

Building from source

Contributing
------------

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the project. We welcome
contributions in any of the following areas:

- Add more JSON + JSON Schema test cases in the
  [`test/e2e`](https://github.com/jviotti/jsonbinpack/tree/main/test/e2e)
  directory
- Improve the documentation at
  [`docs`](https://github.com/jviotti/jsonbinpack/tree/main/docs)
- Suggesting new encodings to make JSON BinPack more space-efficient
- Performance improvements, primarily in the encoder
- General bug fixes

Additionally, we are tracking the following major changes:

- [ ] Re-write the encoders in C++ and compile to WebAssembly
- [ ] Generate serialization and deserialization C++ code that does not
  dynamically traverses the encoding schema for runtime performance reasons
- [ ] Support recursive JSON Schema documents
- [ ] Implement support for the `if`, `then`, and `else` JSON Schema keywords
- [ ] Implement support for the `anyOf` JSON keyword
- [ ] Implement support for inline binary blobs defined with the
  `contentEncoding` JSON Schema keyword

Don't hesitate in getting in touch [by creating a
ticket](https://github.com/jviotti/jsonbinpack/issues/new/choose) if you
require any guidance on contributing to the project.
